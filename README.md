# Reverse an Array
Given an array as an input, write a Java function that will return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge
Write a function called which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach my partner and I took was one in which we modified the array in place and returned it.  We decided on this solution because could have a O(log n) time complexity and save space while sacrificing the integrity of the original data.
