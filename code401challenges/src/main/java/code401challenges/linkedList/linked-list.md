Create a Linked List class in addition to a Node class, head, insert, includes, and toString method.

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

## Approach & Efficiency
Create a LinkedList class with a head and empty constructor.  Create a Node class within the LinkedList class.  The insert method should utilize an O(1) time complexity.
