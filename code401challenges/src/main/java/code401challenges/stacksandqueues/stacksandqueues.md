# Stacks and Queues
Homemade stack and queue data structures.

## Challenge
Create stack and queue data structures.

## Approach & Efficiency
All methods are O(n) space complexity and O(1) time complexity except for queue enqueue method.

## API
Peek method for stack and queue returns value of next node to be popped or dequeued (respectively).

isEmpty method for stack and queue returns a boolean true if empty and false if not empty.

Push method for stack and enqueue method for queue inserts a new node and primitive integer value into data structure.

Pop method for stack (LIFO) and dequeue method for queue (FIFO) removes a node from the data structure.
