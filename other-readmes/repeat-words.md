## Challenge
Write a function which takes in a long string and returns the first repeated word.

## Approach & Efficiency
Use recursive method with helper to process the input string removing punctuations and changing all letters to lower case.  For loop iterates through array of string words returning the first repeated word.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
