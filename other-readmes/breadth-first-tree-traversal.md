## Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
Create queue and enqueue node data by means of tree traversal.  Return the queue.
