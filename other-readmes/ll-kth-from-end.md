## Challenge
A method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Utilized a recursive approach to change one next reference then passed the lists back into the method in alternate argument positions.  O(1) space complexity in addition to occupied stack space during procedure.
