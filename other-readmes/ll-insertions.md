Three new insertion methods.

## Challenge
Write a method that inserts a new node to the end of a singly-linked list.
Write a method that inserts a new node upstream of a designated node value.
Write a method that inserts a new node downstream of a designated node value.


## Approach & Efficiency
Utilize while loops and runners to identify targeted locations.  Perform insertion operation on designated locations.
O(n) time complexity given operation may require traversal of entire data structure.
