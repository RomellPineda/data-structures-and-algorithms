## Challenge
A method that takes in two references to a linked list as paramaters and alternately combines the contents of both lists.

## Approach & Efficiency
Utilized a recursive approach to change one next reference then passed the lists back into the method in alternate argument positions.  O(1) space complexity in addition to occupied stack space during procedure.
